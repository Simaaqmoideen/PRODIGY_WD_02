TASK 02: STOPWATCH WEB APPLICATTION
🚀 Internship Project Update | Prodigy Infotech
I’m excited to share Task 02 from my internship at Prodigy Infotech — a Stopwatch Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ⏱️
🔹 Project Highlights:
Start, stop, and reset stopwatch functionality
Clean and responsive user interface
Accurate time tracking using JavaScript logic
Hands-on experience with DOM manipulation and event handling
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of front-end web development, improve my JavaScript fundamentals, and apply theoretical concepts in a practical way.
Grateful to Prodigy Infotech for the opportunity to learn, build, and grow through real-world tasks 🙌
💡 Looking forward to working on more exciting projects!
